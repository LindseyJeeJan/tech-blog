  ## Description
  Provides a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts. I built this application so that developers can publish articles, blog posts, and share thoughts and opinions on technology. This application uses NodeJS, NPM, MySQL, Express.js, Sequelize, bcrypt, and dotenv.
